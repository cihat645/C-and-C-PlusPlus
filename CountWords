//Goal: To become familiar with characters. Write a program to read a text file and count the number of letters (isalpha), digits (isdigit), punctuation symbols (ispunct), and whitespace characters (isspace) in the file. At the end of the file, the program is to display an appropriate report.

//When you get this working, try also counting the number of words and sentences.
